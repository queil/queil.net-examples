# Embedding F# Compiler

This is an example code for my blog posts:

* https://queil.net/2021/05/embedding-fsharp-compiler/
* https://queil.net/2021/06/embedding-fsharp-compiler-nuget-references/

## Limitations

This code completely and deliberately ignores .NET Framework and it was only tested on linux-x64 with .NET 5. 

## Run

```sh
dotnet run -- Script.fsx
```
